# GroupProject

Run the main function to begin!

WASD to move, mouse to aim, click to shoot, and R to reload when your ten shots are up!
Avoid the Spikys while the game spawns more and more of them, and try to hold out for as long as possible!

Nota bene: enemies have 2 health, but everyone has a brief period of invincibility after taking damageâ€”so pick your targets carefully!
